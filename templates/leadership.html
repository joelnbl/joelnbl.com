    <h2 class="apple-heading">Leadership Principles</h2>
    <p class="text-secondary mb-6">Throughout my career, I've embodied principles that align with industry leadership values. Here's how I demonstrate these principles in my work:</p>
    
    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Customer Obsession</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I start with the customer and work backwards. At ShareableInnovations, I led a UX redesign that increased user satisfaction by 42% by conducting extensive user interviews and implementing feedback loops.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Ownership</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I take ownership of projects from conception to delivery. When our team faced a critical performance issue affecting 10,000+ users, I took the initiative to diagnose and fix the problem, working through the weekend to ensure minimal disruption.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Invent and Simplify</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I developed a custom code generation tool that reduced boilerplate code by 60% and accelerated development time by 35%. This innovation has been adopted across multiple teams and projects.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Sound Judgment</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I make decisions based on data and strong judgment. When choosing our tech stack for a new project, I conducted thorough research and performance testing that led to selecting Next.js, which proved to be the right choice as it reduced our page load times by 45%.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Learn and Be Curious</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I continuously expand my knowledge. I recently completed AWS certification training and implemented serverless architecture in our latest project, reducing infrastructure costs by 30%.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Insist on the Highest Standards</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I implemented comprehensive testing protocols and CI/CD pipelines that increased code coverage from 65% to 92% and reduced production bugs by 78% over six months.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Think Big</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I proposed and led the development of a company-wide component library that standardized UI elements across 12 different products, improving brand consistency and reducing development time for new features by 40%.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Bias for Action</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">When our team identified a security vulnerability, I immediately assembled a task force and implemented a fix within 24 hours, preventing potential data breaches and maintaining customer trust.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="leadership-principle">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Deliver Results</h4>
        <p class="text-secondary">I consistently meet or exceed project goals. In my current role, I've delivered 15 major features on time and under budget, contributing to a 25% increase in user engagement and 18% growth in revenue.</p>
